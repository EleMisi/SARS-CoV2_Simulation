# SARS-CoV2 spread in a company
This project was realized as part of the [*Complex Systems and Network Science*](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/461740) exam of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence,  University of Bologna](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/artificial-intelligence).

The aim of the project is to simulate SARS-CoV-2 spread in a fictional and simplified
company named *CSNS_Group*, and test different countermeasures (**face masks, contact tracing, vaccination**). 

The company has a team-based organizational structure which network of contacts is build using a power-law
distribution. To simulate the **epidemic evolution** and **test different scenarios** we define an **epidemic model** with 6 classes and 5 control parameters.
